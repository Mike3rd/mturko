Congratulations on taking on the 70.3 Half Ironman! February is a great time to build your base fitness and start incorporating more race-specific training. Below is a **4-week training plan** for February, assuming you have a moderate fitness level and can commit to 8–12 hours of training per week. Adjust the intensity and volume based on your current fitness, recovery, and lifestyle.

### **General Guidelines**
1. **Swim**: Focus on technique, endurance, and open-water skills (if possible).
2. **Bike**: Build endurance with long rides and include interval training for speed and power.
3. **Run**: Gradually increase mileage and incorporate brick workouts (bike-to-run) to simulate race conditions.
4. **Strength Training**: Include 1–2 sessions per week to improve muscular endurance and prevent injury.
5. **Recovery**: Listen to your body. Take rest days or easy workouts as needed.
