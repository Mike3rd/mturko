   - Add **race-pace intervals** (e.g., 10x100m at race pace with short rest).  

2. **Bike**:  
   - Build **long rides** up to 3–4 hours to improve endurance.  
   - Include **hill repeats** to build strength and power.

3. **Run**:  
   - Increase long runs to 90–120 minutes to build endurance.  
   - Include **tempo runs** to improve lactate threshold.  
   - Add **brick workouts** (e.g., 2–3 hour bike followed by a 20–40 minute run).  

4. **Strength Training**:  
   - Maintain 1–2 sessions per week, focusing on **muscular endurance**.  
   - Incorporate **plyometrics** (e.g., box jumps, burpees) for power.
