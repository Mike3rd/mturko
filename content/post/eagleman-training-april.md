3. **Run**:  
   - Increase long runs to 2–2.5 hours to build endurance.  
   - Include **tempo runs** and **race-pace intervals** to improve speed.  
   - Practice **negative splits** (running faster in the second half) during long runs.  

4. **Strength Training**:  
   - Reduce to 1 session per week, focusing on **maintenance**.  
   - Avoid heavy lifting to prevent fatigue.  

5. **Recovery**:
